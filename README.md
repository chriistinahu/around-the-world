**Make sure to be clear in ReadMe on what the expected input data should look like**
- Be specific about each of the algorithms
- Have documentation of functions and be clear what it expects (for input) and what the output would look like (is it returned? Is it outputted somewhere?)
- Make sure that functions can be ran with some sort of customized input.
- Code should work with data files that look like as it should be specified in the readme. (ex. If readme says file should look like “name,age,school” then the test data file that they use will be in that format)**
